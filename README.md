# For production:

This section is in progress

# Current bugs:
* if you search for special students and then delete him, it starts displaying all student who left, not the search results

# Plans:
* Replace drop-down list with something else in order to apply custom styles
* Make sorting actually work
* Add links to a navbar (just because)
* Look for mobx and find out how it can be used here
* Same for the TypeScript
* Same for the styled components
